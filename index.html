        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>CSS is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used directly in the HTML file for a specific HTML tag, styling a particular element only</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet is used to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file, in the head element</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet uses a separate file which is linked in the head element</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content</li>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks</li>
          <li>A boolean is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks</li>
          <li>An array is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference. An array is indexed from 0 to size-1</li>
          <li>An object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier</li>
          <li>A comment can be made using /* akwebfiwfuvw */ or // anfekbrgbw</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, a primitive is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties</li>
          <li>Conceptually, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false</li>
          <li>All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy</li>
          <li>for loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. JavaScript for loops take three arguments: initialization, condition, and increment.</li>
          <li>The condition expression is evaluated on every loop. A loop continues to run if the expression returns true</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it</li>
