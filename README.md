# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a student of an upcoming coding bootcamp, I made this webpage to practice some basic coding, and 
to keep notes on our four main topics organized in one place to study from.
This page, and what I learned making it, should help bootcamp be a success.
Through this project I learned some basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
